We thank the referee for a helpful and detailed report.  The assistance with conventions was particularly useful, and we appreciate the referee's attention to detail.

In the reply below, we address the referee's comments.  We have addressed the major comments and several of the PDF annotations directly, but many of the PDF annotations we address in groups and do not individually acknowledge here.

We have bolded all additions.

> Major concerns:
> 
> 1) Tense and voice. Both wander throughout the manuscript and so get in the way of smooth reading. Pick a tense and voice and adhere to them throughout.

We have revised all instances of present-tense first-person language we found.  A further proofread by the editors may yet reveal omissions.

> 2) Color nomenclature matters. Colors are variously called out as F466N-F410M, F410M-F466N, F466N/F410M, and [F410M]-[F466M]. Pick a nomenclature (preferably a conventional one) and stick to it throughout. Especially important is to present the bluer filter first in the subtraction, deviations of which were not caught in the author proofreading.

We have adopted magnitude difference as our color nomenclature, and now hold to the convention of shorter wavelength first.

> 3) "Blueing" as an introduced term should be eschewed. In its usage here, it is NOT on par with reddening and only introduces confusion for less-than-expert readers. Cute, but more problematic than needed. Better to describe how particular colors (involving the F466N filter fluxes or magnitudes) exhibit "deficits" relative to what would be expected for a similar wavelength filter that doesn't overlap major spectral features.

We have replaced blueing throughout the text, but we're a bit blue about it.

> Related to this, but a bit more subtle, is the nature of the reddening vector shown in Figure 4c (bottom right), supposedly computed from CT06. This isn't accurate, as CT06 didn't consider spectral features of CO ice and gas appearing in narrow band filters. It is more accurate to state that absent the presence of the ice and gas spectral features, the Av vector shown would represent the expected broadband reddening. [In looking over CT06, I can't understand why this reference was chosen for the extinction curve calculations, as all the data and fits shortward of 8um are in the Indebetouw+05 and Lutz99 references. Why use CT06?]

Indeed, this is the point of showing that vector: we are comparing a dust-extinction-produced reddening vector to the data.
We have clarified this point in the figure caption.

We added some explanation of the choice of CT06: it is implemented in Karl Gordon's dust extinction package and provides a new fit to the referenced data.  We now cite the original data as well.

> 4) Figure 5 seems to be presented overly late in the manuscript, as some of the discussion about what is sensed through the different JWST filters could be better informed by the figure appearing earlier. This reordering isn't required, but doing so could boost readability and readership. [Do consider inverting the absorption lines, ala Figure 12 in Appendix B - to increase clarity {fewer features plotted over each other} and avoid reader confusion.]

We have moved this figure up slightly.  Because it is fully described later, we present it as a visual summary of the physical explanation for the F466N deficit.
We have modified the figure significantly to clarify and highlight salient points.  

> 5) Figures - there are numerous issues with the figures, as currently presented. I separate these into two aspects: (A) basic considerations and (B) accessibility.
> 
> A) All multi-panel figures: Each panel should be identified within the panel with a (normally capital) letter. Each figure caption should refer to each of the panel identifier letters and the position of the panel on the page. In many places in the text, Figure panels are referred to (e.g., line 339 refers to "Figure 5b" but Figure 5 contains no such designation in either the presented figure panel or in the figure caption. [Note that a couple of the Figure captions call out "left-right" panels when they are instead presented "top-bottom" - closer copyediting would have avoided this error.]

We have added the subplot labels to multipaneled figures.

> Tick marks are normally expected to project INTO the plotted box, not point outside the box to the numerical labels. [Also consider using higher quality fonts in figures - the uniform default nature of the presented fonts and line styles is not in keeping with the high quality of the science being presented.]

Outward facing ticks are matplotlib's default; outward ticks are recommended by many style guides (see discussion at https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/4502/).  Particularly for Figures 1, 2, and 6, inward ticks would be hard to see or would obscure data.  For the other figures, the tick direction does not cause any clear harm.

We have increased figure resolution or switched to vector graphics for the plots.

> Figure 1: has neither directional labels nor angular scales. Neither the text nor the caption explains how the Figure was created (e.g., which filter-images mapped into which color planes). No color lookup table is presented to help the reader interpret the color meanings in the image.

We have changed and clarified the color scheme and added axis labels.

> Figure 2: has neither directional labels nor angular scales - the latter are especially needed for the inserts. This Figure receives only passing reference in the text. Maybe just save it for the press release intended?

We removed this figure.  We will indeed issue a press release and include it.

> B) Accessibility. For individuals who have difficulty distinguishing colors, the use of color as the ONLY way to identify different curves makes those plots unusable. Please examine Figure 8A (top) as a reader having color vision deficiency (CVD) might. The curves merge into each other and are indistinguishable. Instead, there are multiple strategies that can, and should, be employed to convey the information to all readers. These include careful selection of line thicknesses and line styles (dotted, dashed, etc), and when symbols are used, symbol types and sizes (along with thicknesses). There are some excellent computer tools that allow viewing your figures as they would be seen by readers with various types of CVD. Using these tools to inform how best to tweak the colors you do elect to use can help all readers grasp your meanings.

We thank the referee for catching these oversights.  We have now added line styles and/or direct labels to each figure to ensure that all strokes are distinguishable.  

> Good figure design also avoids hiding or overlapping key information. Again, referring to Figure 8A, if the filter transmissions were linked to the right-hand Y-axis with a somewhat different amplitude, the filter curve heights could be chosen so as to not overlap the critical model curves at their apices. Legends should be clear and useful - they should not occult any curves in the plot. (units in legend constants are better than no units, but that can be explained in the captions.) Axis numerical and text labels should not appear crowded or overlapping.

We have fixed these issues.  There are still some overlapping curves, but we now alternate line styles when such overlap occurs.

> Summary - This is going to be a great paper, but it needs attention in several places to clean up errors and to be mindful of the wide variety of potential readers of the final work. Please use the detailed comments and annotations to improve the manuscript - that is their intent in being offered.

> Data Editor's Review:
> One of our data editors has reviewed your initial manuscript submission and has the following suggestion(s) to help improve the data, software citation and/or overall content. Please treat this as you would a reviewer's comments and respond accordingly in your report to the science editor. Questions can be sent directly to the data editors at data-editors@aas.org.
> 
> a) Per our software policy [1], we recommend that authors with living code in a GitHub repository place a "frozen" version on Zenodo (or other 3rd party repository that issues DOIs) [2,3] and then cite the deposited version in the article [4] and it in the reference list. Please pay close attention to the author list for the DOI deposit and that both the GitHub and DOI deposit have valid and consistent software licenses [5].

We have created a release:  DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8313307

> b) It is great that the authors have minted a DOI for the MAST data used in their article. The next step is to include this DOI in the revised manuscript. Ideally, the authors should use the AASTeX "\dataset" command to mark up the DOI so it can be properly tagged in production. An example would be text similar to this:
>

Please review our animation guidelines and upload the animation file with the next revision of the manuscript: https://journals.aas.org/graphics-guide/#animations. For the purposes of increased accessibility of the content we ask that the authors augment their captions for animated figures to include text describing the animation (including durations and annotations), the role of the animation relative to the inline figure, and/or provide a narrative context for readers that can't view the animation.

We don't have any animations or videos, but we would like to provide alternate versions of Figure 1.  Specifically, we have a full-resolution PNG with embedded AVM.


> d) Please include the version of the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline that you used in the text of your manuscript as well as the software citation corresponding to that version so that it appears in the reference list. After selecting the software version in the "Versions" panel on the Zenodo page (https://zenodo.org/record/8067394), citation exports can be found in the "Export" panel.

We added the appropriate reference

This sentence was included unintentionally and has been removed; the original intent was to fit the saturated stars' extended PSFs, then replace the zero'd pixels in the image with the fit values from the PSF.  We didn't end up doing this, though.
We did perform PSF fitting on the saturated stars' extended PSFs, but we did not use the saturated stars for any analysis.
We have now explained this in the text.

Yes, we worry about this.  It does not affect any of the results in this paper, but was a primary limiting factor in the analysis and is why we were unable to include the F187N filter (Paschen Alpha) in the full-field image.

We have clarified this: the large tails are _probably_ from matches to false sources, but this doesn't affect any of our analysis because we exclude sources with large separations between catalogs.

> Shouldn’t the 466N have a brighter 90% limit than the 410M?

Yes, in principle.  We did not carefully examine the reason for the relative shallowness of F410M (it should be deeper than F405N by more than 0.1mag), since we limited our analysis later to stars brighter than 18.5, but likely the cause is confusion: F466N has greater absorption, and therefore less crowding.

No, in this case (the highlight was on "extended PSFs") we are referring to the PSFs around extremely bright stars, which extend 100s of pixels away from the saturated center.

Indeed, this scaling was disconcerting and, it turns out, unnecessary.  We revisited the process and discovered an oversight in the continuum-only image production.  We have reproduced the images and revised the section describing the process.

> The description needs to be much clearer.

We added an explanation here.  The intent is indeed to produce a line-subtracted image, but one in which the stellar flux is reduced.  We describe this as a 'notch filter'.

This is an interesting point, but it is not clear that we have detected extended emission from lines-of-sight to the cloud at all.  Cloudshine is just scattered light, so there is a question of whether we would see reflected recombination line emission or the general (continuum) interstellar radiation field.  In brief, though, this is unlikely to be a significant effect in an environment filled with ionized gas.  If there is any cloudshine, it will be more apparent in broadband images that will become available to the public on September 20.

This question is about what is now Figure 3.  We explain now that stars must be detected in all six filters to be displayed, and therefore removed the specific reference to F187M (though that is, at least in principle, our least-sensitive band at the highest extinction).

We explain now that this is to demonstrate consistency between F187N-F405N and F182M-F410M, which helps demonstrate that the observed blue colors in F466N-containing bands are not an artifact of a different filter.

> CT06 did not compute extinctions for filters containing strong spectral features, so be careful about ascribing such.

This is really the point: none of the dust extinction curves account for narrow spectral features (though many do account for broad silicate features).
We have clarified this by emphasizing that these are dust-only extinction curves.

As an aside, ices have often been ignored in the literature - they are much broader than spectral lines, especially ices other than CO, and therefore are more relevant to broadband photometry.  While ices have been detected spectroscopically for decades, there is little discussion of or evidence for ices photometrically, in large part because very few photometry missions (perhaps just Spitzer) had filters in the appropriate bands.  Considering your points on this figure, we have added text to the introduction to capture this point.

This remains a good point, but all we're trying to show with the emission lines is that their wavelengths do not overlap with CO lines.

Yes, indeed, we had swapped the P- and R-branch labels.
We have now adopted a clearer and more explicit convention: all lines are upper-lower, but connected by an arrow indicating the direction of state change - i.e., absorption is shown with a left-pointing arrow.

This question is about the volume density in the brick.  We have rephrased.  There is some evidence for lower-density gas containing CO, but it would take a lot of text to describe the conditions under which it was detected and is expected.  The point here is merely to acknowledge a possible limitation of the LTE modeling.

This comment was about the subthermal excitation of lines.  We have clarified this a bit, but yes, lower density driving lower excitation temperature could result in stronger absorption within the observed window.

The models shown in Figure 6 do go to the highest plausible column densities and well beyond.  For a canonical CO/H2 = 10^-4, the modeled column densities go to N(H2)=10^24, which is above the maximum observed column density in the brick (5x10^23)

We have added a note about the effect of higher column density.  In brief, panel (b) captures the effect already.

This comment is about the models shown in the CO absorption modeling figure.  Indeed, that's correct: we adopted low column density to illustrate the effect of temperature on level population.  If we adopted a higher column density, all lines would be saturated.  The effect of that saturation is illustrated in the following figure.  Additionally, while the extreme end of column densities goes much higher, most of the stars are at more modest column density.

Because the contours are sequential, the reader should not have to rely on color alone.  We have also made the line widths vary sequentially.

This note was on Figure 10.  We did not change the overplotted curve, electing instead to leave the simplest possible curve - a powerlaw - on the plot.  This curve is not a fit to the data.  We did not explore fitting the data in this work in part because of the enormous scatter at any given A_V.

Yes, which means that the cloud outskirts most likely consist of CO mixed in with other molecules, not pure CO.
We believe this point is already reasonably conveyed in the paragraph, but welcome further suggestions if the referee disagrees.

The metallicity in the Galactic center is higher, so it is plausible (even expected) that the dust-to-gas ratio should be higher.
We added a note about this.
