Using the James Webb Space Telescope, we observed a gas cloud near the center of our Galaxy and found that it is full of ice-encrusted dust particles.  Specifically, we found Carbon Monoxide (CO) ice, and we found a lot more of it than expected.  This discovery tells us where a lot of the CO has been hiding, because previously we have only been able to detect it when it was in the gas phase.  It also tells us that there is an enormous amount of ice in clouds in the center of our Galaxy, which means there's probably a ton of ice in other Galaxy centers too.  We also can now predict that there are other ices, including water ice and CO2 ice, in the cloud.  JWST will detect a lot more ice in the next few years.
